# doge-node
simple command line doge tool. __Created just for fun.__

### how to install?

use the following command (you can use the '-g' switch to install globally):

```
npm install --save-dev doge-node
```

### how to use?

require it as you require your favourite dependencies for example:

```
var d = require('./dogenode')
```

currently there are two production ready methods to use:

```
suchDogeMuchAscii()
```

which prints out a cute little doge to your standard output

```
iicsAhcuMegoDhcus()
```
which prints out a cute little doge BACKWARDS to your standard output __(no magic required!)__
